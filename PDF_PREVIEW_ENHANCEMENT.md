# PDF Preview Enhancement for Assignment Letters

## Overview
Enhanced the AssignmentLetterResource ViewAction to display a modern PDF preview interface with download and print functionality, following SOLID principles and clean code practices.

## Components Created

### 1. PdfPreviewService (`app/Services/PdfPreviewService.php`)
A dedicated service for handling PDF preview operations:
- **getPreviewData()**: Generates preview data including URLs and file information
- **formatFileSize()**: Formats file sizes in human-readable format  
- **generatePrintUrl()**: Creates print-optimized PDF URLs
- **hasFile()**: Checks if a record has an associated PDF file

Key Features:
- Fallback handling for missing files
- Standardized preview data structure
- File size calculation and formatting
- Print-optimized URL generation

### 2. AssignmentLetterFormBuilder (`app/Services/AssignmentLetterFormBuilder.php`)
Form builder service following the Builder pattern:
- **buildFormSchema()**: Creates the complete form schema
- **buildBasicDetailsSection()**: Handles assignment and letter information
- **buildApprovalSection()**: Manages approver selection with toggle
- **buildFileUploadSection()**: File upload with storage health monitoring

Key Features:
- Reactive form fields with live updates
- Storage health status integration
- Default value population from session
- Comprehensive validation rules

### 3. PDF Preview Blade Component (`resources/views/filament/components/pdf-preview.blade.php`)
Modern UI component for PDF viewing:
- **Interactive Buttons**: View, Download, Print with tooltips
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Loading States**: Shows loading spinner during PDF load
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for missing files

Key Features:
- Embedded PDF iframe with optimized parameters
- Print functionality with automatic print dialog
- Download with proper filename handling
- Dark mode support with Tailwind CSS

## ViewAction Enhancement

The AssignmentLetterResource ViewAction now provides:

1. **Structured Information Display**:
   - Letter details in organized sections
   - Device and user information
   - Approval information

2. **PDF Preview Interface**:
   - Embedded PDF viewer with navigation disabled
   - File information header with size display
   - Action buttons for View, Download, Print

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - SlideOver modal for better UX
   - Mobile-friendly interface
   - Proper loading states

## Technical Implementation

### Service Integration
```php
// Dependency injection in ViewAction
$pdfPreviewService = app(PdfPreviewService::class);
$previewData = $pdfPreviewService->getPreviewData($record);
```

### Form Building
```php
// Using the new form builder service
return $form->schema(app(AssignmentLetterFormBuilder::class)->buildFormSchema());
```

### PDF Preview Data Structure
```php
[
    'hasFile' => boolean,
    'fileName' => string,
    'fileSize' => string, // Human readable format
    'previewUrl' => string,
    'downloadUrl' => string,
    'printUrl' => string,
    'message' => string // For error states
]
```

## Benefits

1. **SOLID Principles**:
   - Single Responsibility: Each service has one clear purpose
   - Open/Closed: Easy to extend without modifying existing code
   - Dependency Inversion: Uses interfaces and dependency injection

2. **User Experience**:

   - Quick access to download and print functions
   - Responsive design for all devices

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Separated concerns for better code organization
   - Reusable services for other PDF functionality
   - Clean, testable code structure

4. **Performance**:
   - Lazy loading of PDF content
   - Optimized iframe parameters
   - Efficient file size calculations

## Usage

1. Click the ViewAction button in the table
2. View assignment details in the slideOver modal
3. Preview the PDF file in an embedded viewer
