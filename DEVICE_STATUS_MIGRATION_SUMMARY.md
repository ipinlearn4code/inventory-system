# Device Status Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the `status` field from `device_assignments` table to `devices` table and updated all related components.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
- ✅ **Created migration**: `2025_07_22_022744_move_status_from_device_assignments_to_devices.php`
- ✅ **Added `status` column** to `devices` table with enum('Digunakan', 'Tidak Digunakan', 'Cadangan')
- ✅ **Migrated existing data** from assignments to devices
- ✅ **Removed `status` column** from `device_assignments` table

### 2. Model Updates
- ✅ **Device.php**: Added `status` to $fillable array
- ✅ **DeviceAssignment.php**: Removed `status` from $fillable array

### 3. Controller Updates
- ✅ **AdminController.php**: 
  - Updated all references from `$assignment->status` to `$device->status`
  - Added logic to update device status when creating assignments
  - Added logic to set device status to 'Tidak Digunakan' when returned
  - **NEW**: Added validation to prevent duplicate assignments of same device type/category to same user

### 4. Filament Resource Updates
- ✅ **DeviceResource.php**:
  - Added `status` field to form with default 'Tidak Digunakan'
  - Added `status` column to table with badge colors
- ✅ **DeviceAssignmentResource.php**:
  - Removed `status` field from form
  - Updated table to show `device.status` instead of assignment status
  - Updated filter to use device status

### 5. Service Updates
- ✅ **QuickAssignmentService.php**: 
  - Removed status from assignment creation
  - Added device status update logic

### 6. View Updates
- ✅ **QR Scanner**: Updated to show device status instead of assignment status

### 7. Seeder Updates
- ✅ **DeviceSeeder.php**: Added status field with 'Digunakan' value
- ✅ **DeviceAssignmentSeeder.php**: Removed status field
- ✅ **InventorySeeder.php**: Removed status field from assignments

## New Business Logic

### Device Status Management
- **'Digunakan'**: Set when device is assigned to a user
- **'Tidak Digunakan'**: Set when device is returned or created without assignment
- **'Cadangan'**: Manual status for backup devices

### Assignment Validation
Added new validation in `AdminController.createDeviceAssignment()`:
- Prevents users from having multiple active assignments of the same device type (bribox) within the same category
- Returns error code: `ERR_USER_ALREADY_HAS_DEVICE_TYPE`
- Provides details about existing assignment

## API Response Changes

### Before (Assignment Status)
```json
{
  "assignment": {
    "status": "Digunakan"
  }
}
```

### After (Device Status)
```json
{
  "device": {
    "status": "Digunakan"
  },
  "assignment": {
    // no status field
  }
}
```

## Error Codes Added
- `ERR_USER_ALREADY_HAS_DEVICE_TYPE`: User already has active assignment for same device type/category

## Migration Status
- ✅ Database migration executed successfully
- ✅ All existing data preserved and migrated
- ✅ All controllers updated
