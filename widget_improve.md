## üîç Observations on the *Storage Status* Widget

### 1. **Status Badge Styling**

* **Issue:**
  On storage status widget, the "Healthy" badge feels disconnected from the content and visually inconsistent. It's positioned awkwardly next to the heading and looks cramped.

* **Suggested Fix:**
  Improve padding, font weight, spacing, and surrounding container sizing to make the badge look like a distinct and standard UI element.

### 2. **Responsive Layout Overlap**

* **Issue:**
  On smaller screens or narrower container widths, the widget overlaps the sidebar (`Global Filter`) or is partially hidden behind it.

* **Root Cause:**
  Likely due to:

  * `position: absolute/fixed` without proper layout containment.
  * Sidebar and widget widths not adjusting responsively.
  * Overflow or flex/grid misconfiguration.

* **Suggested Fix:**

  * Use responsive grid/flex layouts with proper `min-w`, `max-w`, `flex-wrap`, or media queries.
  * Ensure `z-index` stacking and `overflow-hidden` are correctly managed.

## ‚úÖ Developer Action List

1. **Badge Styling**

   * Improve appearance and spacing using Tailwind/Filament badge best practices.
   * Ensure it aligns cleanly with text and doesn‚Äôt look cramped.

2. **Responsive Behavior**

   * Test the widget within Filament‚Äôs dashboard layout on smaller screens.
   * Prevent it from overlapping adjacent widgets (e.g., Global Filter).
   * Consider using responsive grid layout:

     ```html
     <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
         <!-- Widgets -->
     </div>
     ```

3. **Optional**

   * Refactor the widget to use `Filament\Widgets\Widget` standard layout tools.
   * Use `Filament\Support\Components\Badge` for consistent status indicators if applicable.
