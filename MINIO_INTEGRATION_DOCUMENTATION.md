# MinIO Integration and Quick Assignment Implementation

## MinIO Storage Integration

### Configuration
- MinIO storage has been configured as a custom disk in Laravel's filesystem
- Uses S3-compatible driver with the following settings:
  - Endpoint: `http://localhost:9000`
  - Access Key: `minioadmin`
  - Secret Key: `minioadmin123`
  - Bucket: `assignment-letter`

### Directory Structure
Files are stored following this structure:
```
{letter-type}/{assignment-id}/{letter-date}/{letter-number}/{filename}
```

### Implementation Components

1. **MinioStorageService**
   - Located at `app/Services/MinioStorageService.php`
   - Handles file uploads, retrievals, and deletions
   - Implements error handling and logging
   - Provides temporary URLs for file access

2. **AssignmentLetter Model Updates**
   - Enhanced to work with MinIO storage
   - Handles proper file paths and URLs
   - Uses transaction-safe file operations

## SQL Error Fix

The "created_by cannot be null" error has been fixed by:
- Setting the `created_by` field in the CreateAssignmentLetter form page
- Getting the current user's ID from the session
- Ensuring the field is always populated in transactions

## Quick Assignment Feature

### Implementation
- Created a new Filament page: `app/Filament/Pages/QuickAssignment.php`
- Added a wizard interface with two steps:
  1. Device Assignment details
  2. Assignment Letter details
- Implemented transactional processing to ensure data consistency

### Key Features
- Single workflow to create device assignments and letters
- File upload directly to MinIO with proper directory structure
- Success/failure notifications with appropriate messages
- Rollback safety if any part of the process fails

### Benefits
- Streamlined user experience
- Reduced errors and inconsistencies
- Better data integrity through transactions
- More efficient workflow

## Testing Guide

2. Fill in the device assignment details and click Next
3. Fill in the assignment letter details and upload a file
4. Click "Create Assignment and Letter"
