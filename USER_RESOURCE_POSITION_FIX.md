# UserResource Position Field Fix

## Issue
The `UserResource.php` file was using an invalid method `allowCustom()` on a Filament Select field, which was causing the following error:

```
BadMethodCallException
Method Filament\Forms\Components\Select::allowCustom does not exist.
```

## Solution
Replaced the Select component with a TextInput component that uses `datalist()` to provide suggestions from existing positions while still allowing custom input:

```php
Forms\Components\TextInput::make('position')
    ->label('Position')
    ->datalist(
        \App\Models\User::query()
            ->whereNotNull('position')
            ->distinct()
            ->orderBy('position')
            ->pluck('position')
            ->toArray()
    )
    ->autocomplete(false)
    ->required(),
```

## Why This Works Better
1. In Filament v3, the `Select` component doesn't have an `allowCustom()` method
2. The `TextInput` component with `datalist()` offers similar functionality - it suggests existing options while allowing the user to type any value
3. This approach is simpler and works well for fields where free input with suggestions is needed

## Alternative Solutions Considered
1. Using `createOptionForm()` with Select - This would require setting up a modal form for adding new positions
2. Using `createOptionAction()` with Select - Similar approach but with more complex setup
3. Using a separate create button - Would add unnecessary complexity

The TextInput with datalist approach provides the best balance of simplicity and functionality for this use case.
