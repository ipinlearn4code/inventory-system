Create a **Laravel API endpoint**:

### `GET /api/v1/devices/scan/{qr_code}`

This endpoint retrieves device details and assignment history based on a scanned QR code with the prefix `briven-`. It is designed for mobile clients to verify and track devices.

### üß† Logic Rules & Data Mapping

1. **Device Lookup**:
   - Find the device by `qr_code` (must start with `briven-`) in the `devices` table.
   - `brand_name`: Combine `bribox.category.name`, `brand`, and `brand_name`.

2. **Assigned To**:
   - Retrieve the active assignment (where `returned_at IS NULL`) from the `device_assignments` table.

3. **History**:
   - Get all device assignments related to the device.
   - For each assignment:
     - **Action**: `"returned"` if `returned_at` exists, `"assigned"` otherwise.
     - **Date**: Use `returned_at` or `assigned_at` based on the action.
     - **Approver**: Taken from the related `assignment_letter.approved_by`.
     - **Note**: From the assignment record.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Requirements

- Use Eloquent relationships and eager loading (`with()`) to avoid N+1 queries.
- Use Laravel API Resources (`DeviceResource`) to shape the output cleanly.
- Return `404` if the device is not found by the given QR code.
- Use parameterized queries or Eloquent ORM to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Validate and sanitize the `qr_code` input before querying the database.
