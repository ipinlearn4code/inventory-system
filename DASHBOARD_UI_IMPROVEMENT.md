## Dashboard Elements

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Professionalism**: The dashboard now presents a more corporate, polished appearance suitable for a financial institution.

2. **Improved Usability**: Better contrast and clearer visual hierarchy make information easier to find and understand.

3. **Reduced Visual Fatigue**: Eliminating excessive visual treatments creates a calmer interface that's comfortable for extended use.

## Implementation

These UI improvements were implemented by:

1. Creating a new `dashboard-theme-improved.css` file
2. Updating the `AdminPanelProvider.php` to use the new CSS
3. Removing inline styles from widget PHP files
4. Building assets with Vite to apply changes system-wide
