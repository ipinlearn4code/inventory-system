# Sidebar Color Customization

## Changes Made to Improve Sidebar Text and Icon Colors

1. **Enhanced Text Color Contrast**
   - Changed the sidebar navigation item text color to pure white (#ffffff) for better readability
   - Changed the sidebar group label (section header) text color to light blue (#a3daff) for better visibility

2. **Interactive Color Changes**
   - Added a bright yellow text color (#ffff00) on hover for high contrast and clear user feedback
   - Active item text color remains white with a blue background for good contrast

3. **Icon Styling Enhancements**
   - Improved icon visibility with matching text colors
   - Added subtle scale animation on hover for better interactivity feedback
   - Ensured consistent color treatment between icons and text

4. **Visual Separation**
   - Added subtle dividers between sidebar groups for better visual organization
   - Enhanced the styling of group collapse/expand buttons for better usability

5. **CSS Variable Updates**
   - Added new CSS variables for sidebar text colors to maintain consistency:
     - `--sidebar-text`: White text for regular items
     - `--sidebar-heading`: Light blue for category headers
     - `--sidebar-hover`: Yellow for hover state

## Benefits
- **Improved Readability**: Higher contrast text makes the sidebar easier to read
- **Better Feedback**: Clear visual feedback when hovering over items
- **Visual Organization**: Better distinction between different sections in the sidebar
- **Consistent Styling**: All sidebar elements follow a consistent color pattern

## How to Test
1. Access the dashboard at http://localhost:8000/admin
2. Check that sidebar text is bright white and clearly visible against the blue background
3. Hover over menu items to see the yellow hover effect
4. Verify that section headers are light blue and stand out from regular items
