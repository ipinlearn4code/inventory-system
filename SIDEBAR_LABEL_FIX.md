# Sidebar Item Label CSS Fix

## Problem
The sidebar labels were not correctly styled according to Filament's class structure:
`fi-sidebar-item-label flex-1 truncate text-sm font-medium text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-400`

## Solution
Updated the CSS to properly target and style the sidebar item labels, ensuring they match Filament's HTML structure while maintaining our custom colors.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `.fi-sidebar-item-label` selector**
   - Fixed font size to match Tailwind's `text-sm` (0.875rem)
   - Applied `font-weight: 500` to match Tailwind's `font-medium`
   - Added flexbox, truncation, and text overflow properties to match Tailwind utilities
   - Set text color to white with !important to override Filament's default colors

2. **Added specific class combination selector**
   - Created a more specific selector targeting Filament's exact class combination
   - Used !important to ensure our styling takes precedence

3. **Enhanced dark mode styling**
   - Updated dark mode selector with a lighter blue color for better visibility
   - Added !important to ensure styling is applied

4. **Added hover and active state styling**
   - Applied the yellow hover effect to labels
   - Added a subtle animation (translateX) for better feedback
   - Ensured active items maintain white text with slightly heavier font weight

## Benefits
- More accurate targeting of Filament's sidebar item label classes
- Better color contrast for readability
- Consistent hover and active state styling
- Properly handles text overflow with truncation

## Testing
1. Verify that sidebar item labels are white and clearly visible
2. Hover over menu items to see the yellow text effect
3. Click on a menu item to ensure the active state is properly styled
4. Check that long labels are properly truncated with an ellipsis

This update ensures our custom theme properly integrates with Filament's class structure while maintaining our desired visual design.
