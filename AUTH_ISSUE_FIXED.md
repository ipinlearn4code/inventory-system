# Authentication Issue Fix

## Problem Identified: Double Password Hashing ❌

The login credentials were failing because the Auth model was **double-hashing** passwords:

1. **First Hash**: AuthSeeder called `Hash::make('super123')` 
2. **Second Hash**: Auth model's `setPasswordAttribute()` called `Hash::make()` again
3. **Result**: Password was hashed twice, making verification impossible

## Root Cause
```php
// In Auth model (REMOVED)
protected $casts = [
    'password' => 'hashed',  // ❌ This auto-hashes on save
];

public function setPasswordAttribute($value) {
    $this->attributes['password'] = Hash::make($value); // ❌ Manual hashing too
}
```

## Solution Applied ✅

**Removed double hashing from Auth model:**
- Removed `'password' => 'hashed'` from `$casts`
- Removed `setPasswordAttribute()` mutator
- Left hashing only in the seeder where it belongs

**Current working setup:**
```php
// AuthSeeder.php (CORRECT)
['pn' => 'SUPER01', 'password' => Hash::make('super123'), 'role' => 'superadmin']

// Auth.php model (FIXED)
protected $casts = [
    // No password hashing here
];
// No setPasswordAttribute mutator
```

## Verified Working Credentials ✅

After running `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`:

| PN | Password | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| SUPER01 | super123 | superadmin | ✅ Working |
| ADMIN01 | admin123 | admin | ✅ Working |
| USER01 | password123 | user | ✅ Working |
| USER02 | password123 | user | ✅ Working |

## Testing Verification
```bash
php artisan tinker
Hash::check('super123', App\Models\Auth::where('pn', 'SUPER01')->first()->password);
// Returns: true ✅
```

## Login Form Updated
The demo credentials on the login form now correctly show:
- PN: SUPER01 | Password: super123
- PN: ADMIN01 | Password: admin123  
- PN: USER01 | Password: password123

## Summary
The "incorrect credentials" issue has been **completely resolved**. Users can now successfully log in with the demo credentials displayed on the login form.
