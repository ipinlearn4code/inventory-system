# File Upload Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing AWS S3 Dependency
We've installed the AWS S3 Flysystem adapter that's required for MinIO storage:

```bash
composer require league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3
```

This resolves the error:
```
Class "League\Flysystem\AwsS3V3\PortableVisibilityConverter" not found
```

### 2. Form Validation Errors
We fixed validation errors related to non-existent fields:
- `No property found for validation: [user_id]` in form submission
- Similar validation errors when setting approvers

### 3. File Type Restriction
We've updated the file validation to accept only PDF and JPG files:
```php
->acceptedFileTypes(['application/pdf', 'image/jpeg', 'image/jpg'])
```

## Implementation Changes

### 1. File Upload Process
We've changed the file upload process to:
1. First upload files to the local disk in a temporary directory
2. After form submission, convert the temporary file to an UploadedFile
3. Use the MinioStorageService to move the file to MinIO storage
4. Delete the temporary local file

### 2. Form Fields Fix
- Added `->dehydrated(false)` to the `is_approver` toggle field to prevent it from being included in validation or model data

### 3. Updated File Upload Components
- Changed all file upload components to use local disk initially
- Updated file type restrictions to PDF and JPG only
- Fixed directory paths for temporary uploads

## Testing
To test these changes:
1. Try uploading a PDF file in the Assignment Letter creation form
2. Try uploading a JPG file
3. Try uploading other file types (should be rejected)
4. Verify that files are correctly stored in MinIO
5. Check that you can download the files after creation

## Notes for Developers
- The temporary upload directory (`temp-uploads`) should be periodically cleaned to avoid accumulating unused files
- If you encounter any S3/MinIO related errors, check your environment variables and MinIO server status
