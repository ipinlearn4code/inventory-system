# CSS Loading Fix

## Problem
The dashboard theme CSS was being loaded with hardcoded asset paths that included version hashes. This approach breaks when rebuilding assets since the hashes change.

## Solution
Implemented a dynamic approach to load CSS assets using the `AssetHelper` class to resolve the correct file paths based on the Vite manifest.json file.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated AdminPanelProvider.php**
   - Replaced hardcoded asset paths with dynamic resolution using AssetHelper:
   ```php
   FilamentView::registerRenderHook(
       PanelsRenderHook::HEAD_END,
       fn (): string => '<script type="module" src="'. \App\Helpers\AssetHelper::versionedAsset('resources/js/app.js') .'"></script>' .
                       '<link rel="stylesheet" href="'. \App\Helpers\AssetHelper::versionedAsset('resources/css/dashboard-theme-improved.css') .'">'
   );
   ```

2. **Using AssetHelper.php**
   - The helper dynamically resolves the correct asset path from the manifest.json file
   - Falls back to scanning the assets directory if manifest lookup fails
   - Provides future-proof loading of versioned assets

### How It Works:
1. When Laravel/Vite builds assets, it creates hashed filenames and a manifest.json
2. The AssetHelper looks up the original resource path (e.g., 'resources/css/dashboard-theme-improved.css') in manifest.json
3. It then returns the correct URL to the hashed file in the build/assets directory
4. If the manifest lookup fails, it falls back to scanning the directory for a matching filename

### Testing:
1. Open http://localhost:8000/admin in the browser
2. Confirm that the dashboard has the BRI blue theme applied
3. Check browser console for any CSS loading errors
4. Rebuild assets with `npm run build` to verify CSS still loads with new hash

This approach ensures that the dashboard theme continues to load correctly even after assets are rebuilt.
